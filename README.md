What is it?

**Try it out!** http://felkerdigitalmedia.com/gltn/edit.php?file=Demo

The goal is to build a better document editor. Word, OpenOffice, Google Docs are all "word processors". You can type things and style things.
But everything you style has to be done yourself.

As a student, I've spent countless hours formatting papers. I spent about an hour formatting a single paper and doing the bibliography.
Yes, tools exist to do this type of thing. I used EasyBib and that saved me some time, but all the other niche details that go into an essay
or another type of paper create a lot of stress and waste a lot of time. When 10% of your grade or more hangs on the tiny details, that's stressful.
Shouldn't writing a paper be about... the content?

The goal of Gluten is to be a lot of different things. Like LaTeX, you write the paper and then it generates a properly formatted paper
based on the type of paper you're writing. Everything, the title, bibliography, in-line citations, etc. are generated automatically from
simple UI elements. 

Automation is at the heart of Gluten. Type a quote in an essay. Context indicates you're going to quote something. So a popup appears.
You can type in the reference details. Then it creates a citation, underlined in blue. That's it. You're done. 

Generate the document. The bibliography appears, everything is perfect. Gluten will use plenty of contextual information to aid you as a writer get
past the boring stuff of writing - formatting and citations and everything else - and let you write.

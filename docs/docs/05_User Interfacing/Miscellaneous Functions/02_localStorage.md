Gltn, by default, stores documents using localStorage. There are a few functions to ping this storage.

## localStorage Used
`getLocalStorageLength()` - Outputs the number of kilobytes of localStorage used

`getLocalStorageOf(String fileid)` - Outputs the number of kilobytes of the Gltn file for a given fileid

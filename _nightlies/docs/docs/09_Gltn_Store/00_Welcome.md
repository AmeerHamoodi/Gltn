The Gltn Store is a central repository for all the plugins developers create. Users can go to one place for an easy way to download and install safe, secure plugins. 

## Featured
Plugins may be featured if they are deemed to be exceptional examples of the Gltn API and solve a real need for the user. Plugins can get featured on the home page, on each category page, or both.

## Developer Portal
Developers can log in using Google to access their plugins, submit new ones, and manage your store account. When you first log in, you see your dashboard. This is a list of all the plugins submitted by you in the store. You can tell at a glance what the status is of your plugins.

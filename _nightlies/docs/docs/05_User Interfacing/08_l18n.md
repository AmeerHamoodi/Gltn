It is easy to localize your plugin to any language in the Gltn Editor. 

## Setting Strings
`Strings` is a global JSON object that each plugin can use to apply languages. The hierarchy for `Strings` is:

* Strings
    * LOCALE_CODE - The code for the language & location such as `en_us`
        * STRING_NAME - The id for the string constant; the value of this string is the text that will be displayed

To add your own strings, simply create new properties for each locale. 

```Javascript
    p.onInit = function() {
        Strings.en_us.MYAPP = "My App";
        Strings.de.MYAPP = "Mein Eep";
        Strings.fr.MYAPP = "Mon App";
    };
```

Alternatively, you can localize your plugin with the word-first model.
```Javascript
    languageManager.addToDictionary("MYAPP", {
        en_us: "My App",
        de: "Mein Eep",
        fr: "Mon App"
    });
```
Either method will do the same thing.

## Data Binding
You can use the same handlebar interface that is used for other data binding systems (wrap the string between two sets of curly braces)
```Javascript   
    {{Locale.WELCOME}}
    {{ Locale.WELCOME }}
```
You may put a space in-between the curly braces and the id of the string.

The `Locale` variable is similar to the `Strings` object, except it is `Strings[LOCALE_CODE]`. So, `Locale.WELCOME` in `en_us` is the same as `Strings.en_us.WELCOME`.

The `Locale` variable changes dynamically based on the locale chosen, so stating `Locale` allows the system to later change the language displayed.

## Refreshing
`applyLocale()` applies takes handlebar strings and turns them into locale objects
`setLocale(LOCALE_CODE)` will apply the correct language string to locale objects

If you use unique methods to inject into the DOM, you may need to use these above functions to be sure your DOM is formatted properly for localization.

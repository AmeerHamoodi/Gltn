## Migrating 1.3.0.* to 1.4.0
This guide is meant to help developers upgrade their plugins to support the newest versions of Gltn.

### Formats
Formats now use the `Format` and `FormatManager` class, but are essentially unmodified in terms of making a format script. Still, you can browse related documentation for more guidance.

Hovertags have now changed dramatically. No longer are they set continually. They're set once using the `Hovertag` and `HovertagManager` classes and then are refreshed to make sure all content is represented.

Tools are now using the `Tool` and `ToolbarManager` classes to complete actions.

### Popups
Popups now use the `Popup` and `PopupManager` classes. See related documentation for more guidance.

### Panels
Panels now use the `Panel` and `PanelManager` classes. See related documentation for more guidance.

### Themes
Themes now use the `Theme` class and a greatly extended `theme` enum. See related documentation for more guidance.

### Dictionaries
Dictionaries now use the `Dictionary` and `DictionaryManager` classes. See related documentation for more guidance.

### New Types
Developers can now create converters, tools, and spreadsheet libraries. These things have been documented.

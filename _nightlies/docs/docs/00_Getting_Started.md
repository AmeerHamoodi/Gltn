**Try it out!** http://felkerdigitalmedia.com/gltn/edit.php

The goal is to build a better word processor. Word, OpenOffice, Google Docs are current products, but all of them are limited in features. You can type things and style things.
But everything you style has to be done yourself.

As a student, I've spent countless hours formatting papers. I spent about an hour formatting a single paper and doing the bibliography.
Yes, tools exist to do this type of thing. I used EasyBib and that saved me some time, but all the other niche details that go into an essay
or another type of paper create a lot of stress and waste a lot of time. When 10% of your grade or more hangs on the tiny details, that's stressful.
Shouldn't writing a paper be about... the content?

The goal of Gltn is to be a lot of different things. Like LaTeX, you write the paper and then it generates a properly formatted paper
based on the type of paper you're writing. Everything, the title, bibliography, in-line citations, etc. are generated automatically from
simple UI elements. 

Automation is at the heart of Gltn. Type a quote in an essay. Context indicates you're going to quote something. So a popup appears.
You can type in the reference details. Then it creates a citation, underlined in blue. That's it. You're done. 

Generate the document. The bibliography appears, everything is perfect. Gltn will use plenty of contextual information to aid you as a writer get
past the boring stuff of writing - formatting and citations and everything else - and let you write.
